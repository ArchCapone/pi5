Original Goal Summary:

  We're setting up a Pi 5 as a travel router for hotel gaming with these specific features:

  1. WiFi Improvement Setup:
    - Pi connects to hotel WiFi
    - Pi broadcasts its own network for your devices
    - Your PC connects via ethernet to Pi for best gaming performance
  2. ProtonVPN Integration:
    - Pi runs ProtonVPN to encrypt all traffic
    - Automatically switches to fastest servers
    - Bypasses hotel throttling/restrictions
  3. Throttling Detection & Bypass:
    - Detects when hotel throttles gaming/VPN traffic
    - Automatically applies countermeasures
    - Monitors speeds and switches VPN servers as needed
  4. Current Status:
    - Ran installation script from GitHub
    - Need to verify what actually installed successfully
    - ProtonVPN command wasn't found, needs troubleshooting
    - Need to check if RaspAP web interface is working
    - Need to test the throttling detection system

  End Result: Pi acts as intelligent middleman between hotel WiFi and your gaming setup, optimizing connection and bypassing restrictions automatically.

  The Pi should create a network you connect to, then intelligently manage the hotel connection in the background.
